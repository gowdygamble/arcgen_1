TODO

[] MAJOR BUG: fill interior cant be random color -> how can it learn the rule of what color,
needs to be based on examples of the task ALL USING THE SAME COLOR


[] what is the output of ARCGEN?

[] should probably use a system of inheritance to manage tasks
i.e. all tasks inherit from a shared generic task
and then you can have task variants that inherit from each other
also, should tasks be classes?


[] stringify function 
take the input/output
write it to a string with <row> and <pair> tokens
write to file

[] some type of config setup to generate a dataset


BUGS
[] sample_task misses new interior regions created by nearby borders




-------
[X] numpy vs lists for example generation
I dont think numpy arrays are actually needed for this...
going with list of lists

[X] need to understand relative imports etc
how to dynamically get a function from a file

[X] example pairs
every function should output example pairs
input -> output subject to a rule
